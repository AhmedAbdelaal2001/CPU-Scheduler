# OS Scheduler Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an OS Scheduler as part of the Operating Systems course at Cairo University. The goal is to create an efficient scheduler that evaluates different scheduling algorithms, implements IPC techniques, and optimizes for performance.

## System Requirements
- **Platform:** Linux
- **Programming Language:** C

## Components
- **Process Generator**
- **Clock Module**
- **Scheduler**
- **Process Simulation**
- **Input/Output Management**

## Algorithms to be Implemented
- Non-preemptive Highest Priority First (HPF)
- Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
- Round Robin (RR)
